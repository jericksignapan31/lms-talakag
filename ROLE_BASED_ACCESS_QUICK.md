## 🔧 How It Works

### **Behind the Scenes**

```
User Logs In
    ↓
Role stored in localStorage ("admin", "teacher", "student")
    ↓
RoleBasedAccessService reads role
    ↓
Component checks permissions
    ↓
UI updates automatically:
  - Menus hidden/shown
  - Form fields hidden/disabled
  - Data filtered
```

### **Example: Teacher Login**

```
Teacher logs in with TeacherID: T001
    ↓
System sets role: "teacher"
    ↓
Menu filters to show only:
  - Books
  - Book Borrowing
    ↓
When viewing borrowings:
  - Only shows T001's borrowings (filtered automatically)
  - No filter dropdown shown
    ↓
When creating borrowing:
  - Borrower type: Auto-set to "teacher"
  - Borrower: Auto-set to T001 (read-only)
  - Book: Choose from list
  - Save: Creates borrowing for T001
```
