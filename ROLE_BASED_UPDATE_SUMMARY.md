# ✅ Role-Based Data Loading Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What Was Updated

I've successfully optimized the **Profile** and **Account Settings** components to properly load user data from the correct Firestore collection based on the user's role.

---

## 📦 Changes Made

### Profile Component (`src/app/pages/profile/profile.ts`)

**Added:**
- ✅ Import `FirestoreAdminService`
- ✅ Method `loadStudentData(lrn)` - Loads from `students` collection
- ✅ Method `loadTeacherData(teacherID)` - Loads from `teachers` collection  
- ✅ Method `loadAdminData(email)` - Loads from `admins` collection
- ✅ Smart role-based branching in `loadUserProfile()`
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

**Improved:**
- ✅ Data loading automatically routes to correct collection
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Merges Firestore data with auth user data

---

### Account Settings Component (`src/app/pages/account-settings/account-settings.ts`)

**Added:**
- ✅ Import `FirestoreAdminService`

- ✅ Method `populateProfileForm(userData)` - Sets form fields
- ✅ Method `loadTeacherData(teacherID)` - Helper method
- ✅ Smart role-based data loading in `loadUserData()`
- ✅ Updated form population from correct collection

**Improved:**

## 🔄 Data Loading Flows

### For Students
```
User (Student) → AuthService provides LRN
                ↓
Profile Component calls loadStudentData(lrn)
                ↓
FirestoreStudentService.getStudentByLRN(lrn)
                ↓
Firestore Query: students collection WHERE lrn == value
                ↓
Data merged into userProfile
                ↓
Display complete student profile
```

### For Teachers
```
User (Teacher) → AuthService provides teacherID
                ↓
Profile Component calls loadTeacherData(teacherID)
                ↓
Query: teachers collection WHERE teacherID == value
                ↓
Data merged into userProfile
                ↓
Display complete teacher profile
```

### For Admins
```
User (Admin/Super-Admin) → AuthService provides email
                          ↓
Profile Component calls loadAdminData(email)
                          ↓
FirestoreAdminService.getAdminByEmail(email)
                          ↓
Firestore Query: admins collection WHERE email == value
                          ↓
Data merged into userProfile
                          ↓
Display complete admin profile
```

## 📋 Collection Reference

### Students Collection
- **Query by:** `lrn` (Learner Reference Number)
- **Service:** `FirestoreStudentService`
- **Fields:** name, lrn, email, birthDate, sex, contactNumber, address, barangay, municipality, province, grade, section, learningModality

### Teachers Collection
- **Query by:** `teacherID`
- **Query Method:** Direct Firestore query with `where()` clause
- **Fields:** name, teacherID, email, birthDate, department, contactNumber, role

### Admins Collection
- **Query by:** `email`
- **Service:** `FirestoreAdminService`
- **Fields:** name, email, adminID, department, role (admin/super-admin), status, createdAt, lastLogin

---

## ✨ Key Improvements

✅ **Accurate Data Loading** - Data comes from correct collection per role  
✅ **No Mixed Data** - Student data stays in students collection, etc.  
✅ **Better Performance** - Queries use specific identifiers  
✅ **Consistent Experience** - Profile and Account Settings use same source  
✅ **Easy Maintenance** - Clear separation by role  
✅ **Error Resilience** - Fallbacks if Firestore data missing  
✅ **Better Debugging** - Console logs show data flow  
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new roles

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Test as Student
1. Login with student credentials (LRN + password)
2. Go to Profile page
3. Verify data matches `students` collection
4. Go to Account Settings
5. Verify form is populated from `students` collection
6. Edit a field and save
7. Verify update went to correct document

### Test as Teacher
1. Login with teacher credentials (teacherID + password)
2. Go to Profile page
3. Verify data matches `teachers` collection
4. Go to Account Settings
5. Verify form is populated from `teachers` collection
6. Edit a field and save
7. Verify update went to correct document

### Test as Admin
1. Login with admin credentials (email + password)
2. Go to Profile page
3. Verify data matches `admins` collection
4. Go to Account Settings
5. Verify form is populated from `admins` collection
6. Review displayed information

## 🎯 What This Solves

**Before:** Profile data was loaded generically without proper role-based collection references.

**After:** Profile and Account Settings now:
- ✅ Load from the **correct Firestore collection** based on role
- ✅ Display **accurate user data** (not mixed between roles)
- ✅ Update **the right documents** in the database
- ✅ Handle all three user types (student, teacher, admin/super-admin)
- ✅ Provide **proper fallbacks** if data not found

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It Works

### Check Console Logs
Open Developer Console (F12) and look for logs like:
```
"Student profile loaded: {...}"
"Teacher profile loaded: {...}"
"Admin profile loaded: {...}"
```

### Check Firestore
Verify that:
1. Student profiles are only in `/students` collection
2. Teacher profiles are only in `/teachers` collection
3. Admin profiles are only in `/admins` collection
4. Each has the appropriate query index (LRN, teacherID, email)

### Test Each Role
1. Login as student → Profile shows student data ✓
2. Login as teacher → Profile shows teacher data ✓
3. Login as admin → Profile shows admin data ✓
