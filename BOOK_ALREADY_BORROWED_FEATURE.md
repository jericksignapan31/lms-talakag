# 📚 Book Already Borrowed - Validation Feature

## ✅ What Was Added?

A new validation feature that prevents borrowing a book that is **already borrowed** by another student. When someone tries to borrow a book that's currently checked out, they'll get a clear error message.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Scenario 1: Book is Available** ✅
```
User tries to borrow a book that hasn't been borrowed yet
    ↓
System checks: Is the book already borrowed?
    ↓
Result: Book is available ✅
    ↓
User can borrow the book successfully
```

### **Scenario 2: Book is Already Borrowed** ❌
```
User tries to borrow a book that someone else has
    ↓
System checks: Is the book already borrowed?
    ↓
Result: Book is currently borrowed by Juan dela Cruz (Due: 2025-11-07)
    ↓
Error message shows who has the book and when it's due
    ↓
User cannot borrow the book
```

---

## 📊 What The System Checks

```typescript
// The system checks if a book is:
✅ Status = 'borrowed'  (Currently borrowed by someone)
✅ Status = 'overdue'   (Borrowed but overdue for return)

// The system ignores:
✅ Status = 'returned'  (Available for borrowing again)
```

---

## 🎨 Error Message Format

When someone tries to borrow an already-borrowed book:

```
❌ Book Already Borrowed

"This book is currently borrowed by: 
 Juan dela Cruz 
 (Due: 2025-11-07)"
```

**The message includes:**
- ❌ Clear error indicator
- 👤 Who currently has the book
- 📅 When the book is due back

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### **Location**
```
File: src/app/pages/borrowing/borrowing.ts
Method: saveBorrowing()
```

### **What It Does**
```typescript
// Step 1: Check if book is already borrowed
const isBookAlreadyBorrowed = this.borrowings().some(
    (borrowing) => 
        borrowing.bookAccessionNumber === this.selectedBookAccessionNumber && 
        (borrowing.status === 'borrowed' || borrowing.status === 'overdue')
);

// Step 2: If already borrowed, show who has it
if (isBookAlreadyBorrowed) {
    const currentBorrowing = this.borrowings().find(...);
    
    this.messageService.add({
        severity: 'error',
        summary: '❌ Book Already Borrowed',
        detail: `This book is currently borrowed by: 
                 ${currentBorrowing?.studentName} 
                 (Due: ${currentBorrowing?.dueDate})`,
        sticky: true
    });
    return;  // Stop the borrowing process
}

// Step 3: If not borrowed, proceed with borrowing
// ... create the borrowing record
```

2. Click "New Borrow"
3. Select a student

5. Click "Borrow"
6. ✅ Should show: "Book borrowed successfully"
```

### **Test Case 2: Try to Borrow an Already-Borrowed Book** ❌

## 🎯 Scenarios Covered

### **Scenario 1: Single Copy Book** ✅
```
Book: "Introduction to Biology" (Only 1 copy)
Status: Currently borrowed by student A

What happens:
└─ Student B tries to borrow it
   └─ System blocks the borrow
   └─ Shows: "Borrowed by Student A (Due: 2025-11-07)"
```

### **Scenario 2: Book Returned and Reborrowed** ✅
```
Book: "Introduction to Biology"
Status: Initially "borrowed"
└─ Student A returns it
   └─ Status changes to "returned"
   └─ Student B can now borrow it ✅
   └─ Status changes back to "borrowed"
```

### **Scenario 3: Overdue Book** ✅
```
Book: "Introduction to Biology"
Status: "overdue" (Borrowed but not returned on time)

What happens:
└─ Student B tries to borrow it
   └─ System blocks the borrow
   └─ Shows: "Borrowed by Student A (Due: 2025-11-07)"
   └─ Reason: Book still hasn't been returned!
```

## 🔄 How It Integrates With Existing System

```
Existing Borrowing Workflow:
1. User fills form (Student, Book, Date)
2. User clicks "Borrow"
3. System validates form (NEW: Also checks if book is already borrowed)
4. If validation passes → Create borrowing record
5. Show success message
6. Refresh borrowing list
```

---

## ✨ Key Benefits

✅ **Prevents Overbooking** - Can't lend same book twice
✅ **Clear Information** - Users know exactly why they can't borrow
✅ **Professional UX** - Prevents errors before they happen
✅ **Easy to Understand** - Simple, clear error message
✅ **Maintains Data Integrity** - Only one active borrowing per book
✅ **Respects Book Status** - Only blocks active borrowings

---

## 📊 Example Messages

### **Success** ✅
```
✅ Success
"Book borrowed successfully. Due date: 2025-11-07"
```

### **Book Already Borrowed** ❌
```
❌ Book Already Borrowed
"This book is currently borrowed by: Juan dela Cruz (Due: 2025-11-07)"
```

### **Book Not Found** ❌
```
❌ Error
"Student or Book not found"
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Validation Logic**
```typescript
// Check if book is already borrowed
this.borrowings().some(
    (borrowing) => 
        borrowing.bookAccessionNumber === this.selectedBookAccessionNumber && 
        (borrowing.status === 'borrowed' || borrowing.status === 'overdue')
)
```

**Explanation:**
- `some()` - Returns true if ANY borrowing matches the condition
- `bookAccessionNumber === ...` - Checks if it's the same book
- `status === 'borrowed' || 'overdue'` - Checks if it's currently active

### **Finding Current Borrower**
```typescript
// Get details about who has the book
this.borrowings().find(
    (borrowing) => 
        borrowing.bookAccessionNumber === this.selectedBookAccessionNumber && 
        (borrowing.status === 'borrowed' || borrowing.status === 'overdue')
)
```

---

## 🚀 Performance

- ✅ **Fast**: Uses in-memory array check (instant)
- ✅ **No Database Queries**: Uses already-loaded data
- ✅ **No Delay**: User sees result immediately
- ✅ **Efficient**: O(n) complexity where n = number of borrowings

---

## 📝 Notes

### **What It Checks**
```
✅ Checks if book is actively borrowed
✅ Checks if book is overdue (still not returned)
✅ Shows who has the book
✅ Shows when it's due back
```

### **What It Doesn't Check**
```
❌ Multiple copies of same book (treats all as same)
❌ Student who last borrowed it
❌ How many times book was borrowed
```

**Note**: If you want to support multiple copies of the same book, you'll need to add a copy/edition field to the Book model.

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
1. **Copy/Edition Field** - Support multiple copies per title
2. **Waitlist** - Let students wait for unavailable books
3. **Email Notification** - Notify student when book is due to be returned
4. **SMS Alert** - Text message when book becomes available
5. **Book Reservation** - Reserve a book before it's returned

## 📞 Support

### **Question: Can I borrow the same book twice?**
A: No. Once a book is borrowed and not returned, the validation prevents another borrow.

### **Question: What if the book was returned?**
A: If the book's status is "returned", the validation allows borrowing again.

### **Question: What if I return the book early?**
A: Once returned (status = "returned"), someone else can immediately borrow it.

### **Question: Can multiple students borrow at once?**
A: No. Only one student can have a book at a time.
