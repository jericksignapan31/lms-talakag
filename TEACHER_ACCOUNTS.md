# Teacher Account System

## Overview

The LMS Talakag now includes a complete teacher account management system that automatically creates Firebase accounts for teachers with their Teacher ID as both username and password.

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Account Creation**
- When a new teacher is added to the Teacher Users table, a Firebase account is automatically created
- Email format: `{teacherID}@lms.talakag`
- Username: `{teacherID}`
- Password: `{teacherID}` (same as username for easy access)

### 2. **Teacher Login**
- Teachers can log in using their Teacher ID and password
- Login page now includes a user type selector (Student or Teacher)
- Separate authentication paths for students (LRN) and teachers (Teacher ID)

### 3. **Automatic Account Deletion**
- When a teacher is deleted, their Firebase account is also deleted
- Confirmation dialog warns that the account will be deleted

## User Workflows

### Adding a New Teacher

1. Click "New Teacher" button in Teacher Users page
2. Fill in teacher details:
   - Name
   - Teacher ID (unique identifier)
   - Birth Date
   - Department
   - Email
   - Contact Number
3. Click "Save"
4. System automatically creates Firebase account:
   - Email: `{teacherID}@lms.talakag`
   - Password: `{teacherID}`
5. Success message displays credentials

### Teacher Login

1. Go to login page (`/auth/login`)
2. Select "üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher" from user type dropdown
3. Enter Teacher ID
4. Enter Password (same as Teacher ID)
5. Click "Sign In"

### Deleting a Teacher

1. Click trash icon next to teacher in Teacher Users table
2. Confirm deletion
3. System automatically:
   - Removes teacher from Firestore
   - Deletes Firebase account
4. Success message confirms deletion

### Editing a Teacher

1. Click edit icon next to teacher
2. Modify teacher details
3. Click "Save"
4. **Note:** If Teacher ID is changed, a new account will need to be created manually or teacher record updated

## Error Handling

### Account Creation Failures
- If account creation fails, teacher is still added to Firestore
- Warning message displayed: "Partial Success - Teacher Added but Account Creation Failed"
- Teacher can still be managed in the system

### Account Deletion Failures
- If account deletion fails, teacher record is still deleted from Firestore
- Warning logged to console
- Allows cascade deletion without blocking UI

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ Teacher ID used as password for simplicity
- ‚úÖ Email format follows pattern: `{teacherID}@lms.talakag`
- ‚úÖ Firebase authentication secures credentials

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Separate Password Field**: Allow teachers to set custom passwords
2. **Password Reset**: Implement password reset functionality
3. **Account Status**: Add active/inactive status for teachers
4. **Login Attempts**: Implement login attempt tracking
5. **Session Management**: Add session timeout and auto-logout

## Authentication Flow

### Student Authentication
```
Username (LRN) + Password (LRN or LRN@123)
                ‚Üì
         login(lrn, password)
                ‚Üì
    Email: {lrn}@lms.talakag
           Password Formats:
           - {lrn}@123 (new)
           - {lrn} (old, backward compatible)
                ‚Üì
        Firebase Authentication
                ‚Üì
        Role: "student"
```

### Teacher Authentication
```
Username (Teacher ID) + Password (Teacher ID)
                ‚Üì
      loginWithTeacherID(teacherID, password)
                ‚Üì
    Email: {teacherID}@lms.talakag
           Password: {teacherID}
                ‚Üì
        Firebase Authentication
                ‚Üì
        Role: "teacher"
```
