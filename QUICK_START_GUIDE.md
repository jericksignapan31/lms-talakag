## 📊 Data Stored

Your profile information is stored in:
- **Firestore Database**: Personal and address information
- **Firebase Authentication**: Password and email

The app loads data from:
1. Current user session (AuthService)
2. Firestore student/teacher collection
3. Firebase authentication

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Services Used
- `AuthService` - User authentication state
- `FirestoreStudentService` - Student data operations
- `FirestoreTeacherService` - Teacher data operations
- `LmsAuthService` - Firebase auth operations
- `FirebaseService` - Firestore database access

### Data Sources
- **Firestore Collections**: `students`, `teachers`, `admins`
- **Firebase Auth**: User credentials and authentication

---

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Change Styling
All styling uses Tailwind CSS. To customize:
1. Open the component file
2. Find the `template` property in `@Component`
3. Look for Tailwind classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500`, `px-4 py-2`)
4. Change colors, spacing, sizes as needed

Example:
```typescript
// Change button color from blue to green
// From: class="bg-blue-500"
// To:   class="bg-green-500"
```

### Add New Form Fields
1. Add field to the form group in `initializeForms()`
2. Add input in the template
3. Add to Firestore update logic

### Change Icon
Replace icon classes (e.g., `pi-user` → `pi-id-card`)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Email Cannot Be Changed
- Email is managed by the system
- Contact your administrator to change email

### School-Managed Fields
- Grade, Section, Learning Modality cannot be edited by students
- These are managed by your school
- Contact your school to update these

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 6 characters
- Case-sensitive
- Cannot be same as current password

### Reauthentication
- Required when changing password for security
- Your current password must be correct
- This prevents unauthorized password changes

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Current password is incorrect"
→ Make sure you entered your login password correctly

### "Passwords do not match"
→ Ensure New Password and Confirm Password are identical

### Data not saving
→ Check internet connection and try again

### Cannot access Account Settings
→ Make sure you're logged in (check if redirected to login)

### Styling looks wrong
→ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del or Cmd+Shift+Del)
