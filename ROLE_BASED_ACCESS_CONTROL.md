## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **File 1: `src/app/services/role-based-access.service.ts` (NEW)**

**Purpose:** Central service for managing role-based permissions

**Key Components:**
- `RolePermissions` interface - defines all permissions
- `getPermissionsForRole()` - returns permissions for a specific role
- `canAccess()` - check if feature is allowed
- `shouldFilterByCurrentUser()` - check if need to filter data
- `getCurrentUserIdentifier()` - get LRN (student), TeacherID (teacher), or Email (admin)
- `getCurrentUserType()` - get current user type

**Permissions Defined:**
```typescript
{
    canAccessStudentUsers: boolean,
    canAccessTeacherUsers: boolean,
    canAccessAdminUsers: boolean,
    canAccessBooks: boolean,
    canAccessBorrowing: boolean,
    canAccessBorrowingManagement: boolean,
    canAccessPenalties: boolean,
    canChangeBorrowerType: boolean,
    canFilterBorrowings: boolean,
    canFilterPenalties: boolean,
    canAccessAllData: boolean
}
```

### **File 2: `src/app/layout/component/app.menu.ts` (UPDATED)**

**Changes Made:**
- Added `RoleBasedAccessService` injection
- Created `filteredModel` computed property
- Menu items now filtered based on role
- Only show pages user has access to

**Before:**
```html
<!-- All menu items always shown -->
- Books
- Book Borrowing
- Student Users
- Teacher Users
- Admin Users
```

**After:**
```html
<!-- For Admin/Super-Admin -->
- Books
- Book Borrowing
- Student Users
- Teacher Users
- Admin Users

<!-- For Teacher/Student -->
- Books
- Book Borrowing
```

### **File 3: `src/app/pages/borrowing/borrowing.ts` (UPDATED)**

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added Service Injection:**
   ```typescript
   private rbacService = inject(RoleBasedAccessService);
   private authService = inject(AuthService);
   ```

2. **Added Computed Properties:**
   ```typescript
   isAdmin = computed(() => this.rbacService.isAdmin());
   isTeacher = computed(() => this.rbacService.isTeacher());
   isStudent = computed(() => this.rbacService.isStudent());
   canChangeBorrowerType = computed(() => this.rbacService.canAccess('canChangeBorrowerType'));
   shouldShowFilters = computed(() => this.rbacService.canAccess('canFilterBorrowings'));
   currentUserIdentifier = computed(() => this.rbacService.getCurrentUserIdentifier());
   ```

3. **Updated loadBorrowings():**
   - Filters data by current user if not admin
   - Teacher sees only their borrowings
   - Student sees only their borrowings
   - Admin sees all borrowings

4. **Updated loadPenalties():**
   - Filters data by current user if not admin
   - Teacher sees only their penalties
   - Student sees only their penalties
   - Admin sees all penalties

5. **Updated openBorrowDialog():**
   - For admin: shows borrower type dropdown
   - For teacher: auto-sets to "teacher" and current teacher
   - For student: auto-sets to "student" and current student

6. **Updated HTML Template:**
   - Hides borrower type dropdown for teacher/student
   - Shows informational message "You are automatically set as the borrower"
   - Hides filters for teacher/student
   - Changes header to "My Borrowings" for non-admin
   - Disables borrower selection field for teacher/student

```
1. Open "New Borrow"
2. Select Borrower Type: Student / Teacher
3. Select specific student/teacher
4. Select book
5. Set borrow date
6. Save
→ Borrowing created for selected person
```

### **When Teacher Creates Borrowing:**

1. Open "New Borrow"
2. Borrower Type: Hidden (auto "teacher")
3. Borrower: Hidden (auto current teacher)
4. Select book
5. Set borrow date
6. Save
→ Borrowing created for current teacher
```

### **When Student Creates Borrowing:**
```
1. Open "New Borrow"
2. Borrower Type: Hidden (auto "student")
3. Borrower: Hidden (auto current student)
4. Select book
5. Set borrow date
6. Save
→ Borrowing created for current student
```

### **Viewing Borrowing Management:**

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. Role Identification**

When user logs in:
```typescript
// AuthService stores user with role
{
    id: "uid",
    username: "T001",
    teacherID: "T001",
    role: "teacher",  // ← Role is set here
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@lms.talakag"
}
```

### **2. Permission Checking**

When component loads:
```typescript
// RoleBasedAccessService reads role from localStorage
const role = this.authService.currentUser.role; // "teacher"

// Gets permissions for that role
const permissions = this.getPermissionsForRole(role);

// Computed properties return permissions
this.canChangeBorrowerType(); // false for teacher
this.shouldShowFilters(); // false for teacher
```

### **3. Data Filtering**

When loading data:
```typescript
// Check if should filter by current user
if (this.rbacService.shouldFilterByCurrentUser()) {
    const currentUserID = this.rbacService.getCurrentUserIdentifier(); // "T001"
    
    // Filter data to only match current user
    data = data.filter(item => item.studentLRN === currentUserID);
}
```

### **4. UI Adaptation**

Components update automatically:
```typescript
// In template
<div *ngIf="canChangeBorrowerType()">
    <!-- Only show for admin -->
    <p-select ...></p-select>
</div>

<div *ngIf="!canChangeBorrowerType()">
    <!-- Only show for teacher/student -->
    <p-select [disabled]="true"></p-select>
</div>
```

## 🔐 Security Benefits

1. **Frontend Protection:**
   - Menus hidden for unauthorized access
   - Forms disabled/hidden for non-admins
   - Data filtered by current user

2. **Backend Validation:**
   - (Recommended) Add server-side validation
   - Verify role before returning data
   - Prevent unauthorized data access

3. **Data Privacy:**
   - Teachers only see own borrowings
   - Students only see own borrowings
   - Admins can see all (intentional)

---

## 📋 API Endpoints (Recommendations)

For additional security, consider adding backend validation:

```typescript
// teacher-service
GET /api/borrowings?teacherID=T001
// Returns only that teacher's borrowings

// student-service
GET /api/borrowings?studentLRN=S001
// Returns only that student's borrowings

// admin-service
GET /api/borrowings
// Returns all borrowings (with authorization header check)
```
