## 🎯 How It Works

### **Simple Version**
```
User tries to borrow a book
    ↓
System checks: Is this book already borrowed?
    ├─ If YES → Show error with borrower details
    └─ If NO → Create borrowing record
```

### **Detailed Version**
```typescript
// When user clicks "Borrow"
1. Validate form (Student & Book selected)
2. Check if book is already borrowed
   - Query: bookAccessionNumber matches
   - Query: status = 'borrowed' OR 'overdue'
3. Decision:
   - If found: Show error ❌
     - Show borrower name
     - Show due date
     - Keep dialog open for retry
   - If not found: Proceed ✅
     - Create borrowing record
     - Refresh table
     - Show success
```
