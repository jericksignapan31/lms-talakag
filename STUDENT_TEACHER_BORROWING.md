## 🔄 Business Logic

### **Borrow Process**
1. User selects **Borrower Type** (Student/Teacher)
2. System filters list based on type
3. User selects individual borrower
4. User selects book
5. System checks if book is available
6. If available: Creates borrowing record
7. If not available: Shows error with current borrower details

### **Same Rules Apply**
- ✅ **Borrow Period**: 14 days (same for both)
- ✅ **Penalty Rate**: ₱20/day (same for both)
- ✅ **Max Copies**: Only 1 active borrowing per book
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Borrowed → Returned or Overdue
