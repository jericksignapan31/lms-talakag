## If Install Prompt Doesn't Appear

1. **Check Chrome DevTools (F12)**
   ```
   Application → Service Workers → Check if registered
   Application → Manifest → Should load without errors
   Console → Look for any error messages
   ```

2. **Verify:**
   - HTTPS is enabled (or localhost)
   - manifest.json is accessible
   - Icons exist in correct locations
   - Service worker file exists
   - No CORS errors

3. **Try:**
   - Clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
   - Rebuild: npm run build
   - Check Network tab for icon loads

**💡 Pro Tips:**
- 192×192 and 512×512 icons are most important (marked as maskable)
- Test on actual device, not just browser
- HTTPS required on production (except localhost)
- Some browsers cache manifest for 24 hours
- Clear cache if changes don't appear
