## Alternative: Use Free Alternatives

If you don't want to upgrade to paid:

### Option 1: Firestore with Base64 Images
- Store small images as Base64 in Firestore
- Not recommended (data usage increases)
- Limited to ~1MB per field

### Option 2: External Free Storage
- Use free services like **Imgur**, **Cloudinary**, or **imgbb**
- Generate public URLs manually
- Store URLs in Firestore

### Option 3: Use only LMS without photos
- Skip photo uploads entirely
- Just use names and LRNs
- Add photos later when you upgrade

## FAQ

### Q: Do I have to pay monthly?

**A:** Not necessarily! If you stay within the free tier (5GB storage, 1GB download), you pay **$0/month**. You only pay when you exceed the limits.

### Q: Can I downgrade later?

**A:** Yes! You can delete the billing account anytime, but your project will become read-only for Cloud Storage.

### Q: Is my data safe?

**A:** Yes! Google manages all security. Your data is encrypted and backed up.

### Q: How long does it take to activate?

**A:** Usually 5-15 minutes after payment verification.

### Q: Can I use a debit card?

**A:** Yes! Most debit cards work. Google requires verification (small charge, then refund).
