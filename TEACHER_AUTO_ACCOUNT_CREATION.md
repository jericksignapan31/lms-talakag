## 💻 Code Example

### **What Happens During Import**
```typescript
// For each teacher in the import file:

try {
    // 1. Create Firebase account
    await this.authService.createTeacherAccount(teacher.teacherID);
    
    // 2. Save teacher to Firestore
    await this.teacherService.addTeacher(teacher);
    
    // 3. Count success
    successCount++;
} catch (error) {
    // If account creation fails:
    // - Log error
    // - But still save teacher record
    // - Continue with next teacher
    console.warn(`Error creating account for ${teacher.teacherID}:`, error);
}

// Show results to user
messageService.add({
    severity: 'success',
    detail: `Successfully imported ${successCount} teacher(s)`
});
```

## ✅ Error Handling

### **Scenario 1: Duplicate Teacher**
```
If teacher with same TeacherID already exists:
✅ Teacher record saved
⚠️ Firebase account creation fails (duplicate email)
✅ System continues with next teacher
📝 Error logged to console
```

### **Scenario 2: Network Error**
```
If Firebase connection fails:
✅ Firestore still saves teacher record
❌ Firebase account not created
📝 Error logged to console
```

### **Scenario 3: Invalid TeacherID**
```
If TeacherID has special characters:
✅ Email sanitized and created
✅ Teacher record saved
📝 Details logged to console
```

└─ Time consuming & error-prone
```

### **AFTER** ✅
```
Action: Import 10 teachers via CSV

Result:
├─ Teachers saved to database ✅
├─ Firebase accounts created automatically ✅
├─ Teachers can login immediately ✅
└─ Zero manual work needed!

   └─ Other fields: Contact, Birth Date

2. Open LMS Application
   └─ Go to Teacher Users page

## 📞 FAQ

**Q: How many teachers can I import at once?**
A: No limit - import as many as needed. System handles them sequentially.

**Q: What if import fails halfway?**
A: Teachers imported before the error are saved. Check console for which one failed.

**Q: Can I import the same file twice?**
A: Not recommended - will attempt to create duplicate accounts. Use unique TeacherIDs.

**Q: What's the default password?**
A: Same as TeacherID (e.g., if TeacherID is "T001", password is "T001").

**Q: Can I change this password?**
A: Yes - after teacher logs in, they can change it through account settings.

**Q: Do I need to do anything special?**
A: No - just prepare CSV file and import normally. System handles everything automatically.
