# ✅ Icons Fixed! - Now Run Production Server Correctly

## ✅ Status Update

Icons have been **generated successfully**! ✅

```
✅ Generated 8 icon files
✅ Generated 2 screenshot files
✅ Rebuilt production bundle
✅ All files in dist/sakai-ng/browser/
```

---

## 🔧 Problem You Saw

```
Error (404): "Not found" for /assets/icon-144x144.png
```

**Reason**: HTTP server serving from wrong folder or not restarted

**Solution**: Make sure you're serving from correct folder

---

## ✅ Correct Way to Serve

### Make Sure You're Using This EXACT Command:

```bash
npx http-server dist/sakai-ng/browser -p 8080 --ssl --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```

### Important Points:
- ✅ `dist/sakai-ng/browser` - Correct folder (has the icons)
- ✅ Port `8080`
- ✅ HTTPS with SSL
- ✅ NOT just `dist/sakai-ng` (that's wrong!)

---

## 📋 Checklist Before Running

- [ ] Ran `node scripts/generate-icons-nodejs.js` ✅
- [ ] Ran `npm run build` ✅
- [ ] Icons exist in `dist/sakai-ng/browser/`
- [ ] Stopped old http-server (if running)

## 🔍 Verify Icons Load

### Check in DevTools (F12)

1. **Open Network tab**
2. **Look for icon requests**
3. Should see: `GET /icon-192x192.png` → Status 200 ✅

### Or directly test icons:
```
https://localhost:8080/icon-192x192.png
https://localhost:8080/icon-512x512.png
```

Should download the image files!

## 🆘 If Still Getting 404

### Check 1: Verify Icons Exist
```bash
ls -la dist/sakai-ng/browser/icon-*.png
```

Should list 8 icon files

### Check 2: Verify Server Folder
```bash
ls -la dist/sakai-ng/browser/
```

Should contain manifest.json, icons, screenshots

### Check 3: Restart Server
```bash
# Stop (Ctrl + C)
# Start again:
npx http-server dist/sakai-ng/browser -p 8080 --ssl --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```

### Check 4: Clear Browser Cache
```
DevTools (F12)
→ Network tab
→ Right-click "Disable cache"
```

Then reload page
