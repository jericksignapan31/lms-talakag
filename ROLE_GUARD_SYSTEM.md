WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ NEW FILES CREATED:
├─ src/app/pages/auth/role.guard.ts
│  └─ RoleGuard - Protects routes based on roles and permissions

✅ UPDATED FILES:
├─ src/app/pages/pages.routes.ts
│  └─ Added RoleGuard to all protected routes
│
└─ src/app/services/role-based-access.service.ts
   └─ Added getRoleValue() method for guard access

ROUTE PROTECTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Protected Routes with Permissions:

1. /pages/crud (Books)
   ├─ Required Permission: canAccessBooks
   ├─ Allowed: Admin, Super-Admin
   └─ Blocked: Teacher, Student

2. /pages/borrowing (Book Borrowing)
   ├─ Required Permission: canAccessBorrowing
   ├─ Allowed: Admin, Super-Admin, Teacher, Student
   └─ Blocked: None

3. /pages/teacher (Teacher Users)
   ├─ Required Permission: canAccessTeacherUsers
   ├─ Allowed: Admin, Super-Admin
   └─ Blocked: Teacher, Student

4. /pages/admin (Admin Users)
   ├─ Required Permission: canAccessAdminUsers
   ├─ Allowed: Admin, Super-Admin
   └─ Blocked: Teacher, Student

5. /pages/users (Student Users)
   ├─ Required Permission: canAccessStudentUsers
   ├─ Allowed: Admin, Super-Admin
   └─ Blocked: Teacher, Student

HOW IT WORKS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. User clicks on menu item or enters URL directly
2. Angular router checks canActivate guard (RoleGuard)
3. RoleGuard gets user's current role from RoleBasedAccessService
4. Checks if user has required permission
5. If allowed → Page loads ✅
6. If blocked → Error toast + Redirect to dashboard ❌

ACCESS CONTROL:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

| Route           | Admin | Super-Admin | Teacher | Student |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| /pages/crud     | ✅    | ✅        | ❌      | ❌      |
| /pages/borrowing| ✅    | ✅        | ✅      | ✅      |
| /pages/teacher  | ✅    | ✅        | ❌      | ❌      |
| /pages/admin    | ✅    | ✅        | ❌      | ❌      |
| /pages/users    | ✅    | ✅        | ❌      | ❌      |

SECURITY LAYERS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🛡️ Layer 1: Menu Filtering
   └─ Hides menu items based on role (app.menu.ts)

🛡️ Layer 2: Route Guards
   └─ Prevents route access if user doesn't have permission (role.guard.ts)

🛡️ Layer 3: Component Restrictions
   └─ Hides UI elements based on role (CRUD, Borrowing components)

🛡️ Layer 4: Data Filtering
   └─ Only shows user's own data (RoleBasedAccessService)

BENEFITS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Secure - Users can't access pages they shouldn't
✅ User-Friendly - Clear error messages when access denied
✅ Consistent - Permissions centralized in RoleBasedAccessService
✅ Scalable - Easy to add new routes with permission checks
✅ Flexible - Both role-based and permission-based guards available

TESTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Test as Admin:
✅ Can access: crud, borrowing, teacher, admin, users
✅ Can click all menu items
✅ Can see all buttons

Test as Teacher:
❌ Cannot access: crud, teacher, admin, users
✅ Can access: borrowing
❌ Cannot see restricted menu items
❌ Cannot click restricted buttons

Test as Student:
❌ Cannot access: crud, teacher, admin, users
✅ Can access: borrowing
❌ Cannot see restricted menu items
❌ Cannot click restricted buttons

VERIFICATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Compilation:     ZERO ERRORS
✅ TypeScript:      STRICT MODE PASSES
✅ Route Guards:    ACTIVE
✅ Permissions:     ENFORCED
✅ Production Ready: YES
