## 📋 What Was Done

### **Code Changes**
```
File: src/app/pages/borrowing/borrowing.ts
Method: saveBorrowing()

Added:
├─ Check if book is already borrowed
├─ Show who currently has the book
├─ Show when the book is due back
└─ Prevent duplicate borrowing
```

### **Validation Logic**
```typescript
// Before borrowing a book, the system now:
1. Checks all current borrowings
2. Looks for matching book accession number
3. Checks if status is 'borrowed' or 'overdue'
4. If found, shows error with borrower details
5. If not found, allows the borrow
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Step-by-Step**
```
User fills borrow form
    ↓
User clicks [Borrow]
    ↓
System validates form
    ↓
System checks: Is this book already borrowed? ← NEW!
    ├─ If YES → Show error: "Book Already Borrowed"
    │          Show who has it and due date
    │          Stop the process
    └─ If NO → Create borrowing record
              Show success message
              Refresh the table
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

### **Test 1: Available Book** ✅
```
1. Go to Book Borrowing page
2. Find a book NOT in the borrowed table
3. Click [New Borrow]
4. Select student and book
5. Click [Borrow]
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Book borrowed
```

### **Test 2: Already Borrowed Book** ❌
```
1. Look at borrowed books table
2. Pick a book with status "borrowed"
3. Click [New Borrow]
4. Select student and THAT SAME BOOK
5. Click [Borrow]
Result: ❌ ERROR - "Book Already Borrowed by [Name] (Due: [Date])"
```

---

## 📊 Error Message Example

```
When trying to borrow an already-borrowed book:

┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ❌ Book Already Borrowed             │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ This book is currently borrowed by:  │
│ Juan dela Cruz                       │
│ (Due: 2025-11-07)                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Respects Book Status
   └─ Only blocks 'borrowed' or 'overdue' books
   └─ Allows borrowing of 'returned' books

✅ Fast
   └─ No database queries needed
   └─ Uses cached data

✅ User-Friendly
   └─ Easy to understand error message
   └─ Helpful details provided
```

---

## 🔍 What It Checks

### **Checks these statuses (blocks borrowing)**
```
✅ 'borrowed'  - Book currently borrowed
✅ 'overdue'   - Book borrowed but not returned on time
```

### **Ignores these statuses (allows borrowing)**
```
✅ 'returned'  - Book has been returned (available)
```

---

## 📝 Code Example

### **The Check**
```typescript
// Check if book is already borrowed
const isBookAlreadyBorrowed = this.borrowings().some(
    (borrowing) => 
        borrowing.bookAccessionNumber === this.selectedBookAccessionNumber && 
        (borrowing.status === 'borrowed' || borrowing.status === 'overdue')
);

// If borrowed, show error
if (isBookAlreadyBorrowed) {
    const currentBorrowing = this.borrowings().find(...);
    
    this.messageService.add({
        severity: 'error',
        summary: '❌ Book Already Borrowed',
        detail: `This book is currently borrowed by: ${currentBorrowing?.studentName} (Due: ${currentBorrowing?.dueDate})`,
        sticky: true
    });
    return;
}

// Otherwise, proceed with borrowing
```

---

## 📊 User Workflow (Updated)

### **Before** ❌
```
User → Fill form → Click Borrow → System creates duplicate → ERROR in data
```

### **After** ✅
```
User → Fill form → Click Borrow → System checks if available → 
├─ If available: Create borrowing → Success
└─ If already borrowed: Show error with details → Try again
```

---

## 🎯 Scenarios Covered

### **Scenario 1: First borrow**
```
Book: Biology 10 (never borrowed before)
Status: Not in table (no borrowing record)
Result: ✅ Can borrow
```

### **Scenario 2: Already borrowed**
```
Book: Biology 10 (currently borrowed)
Status: "borrowed" in table
Result: ❌ Cannot borrow - shows current borrower
```

### **Scenario 3: Overdue book**
```
Book: Biology 10 (borrowed but overdue)
Status: "overdue" in table
Result: ❌ Cannot borrow - shows current borrower
```

### **Scenario 4: Returned and reborrow**
```
Book: Biology 10 (was borrowed, now returned)
Status: "returned" in table
Result: ✅ Can borrow again
```

## 📞 FAQ

### **Q: Can two students borrow the same book?**
A: No. Once a book is borrowed, no one else can borrow it until it's returned.

### **Q: What if the book has multiple copies?**
A: Currently, all copies are treated as the same. If you need to support multiple copies, the Book model needs a copy/edition field.

### **Q: What happens when a book is returned?**
A: Its status changes to "returned" and the validation allows it to be borrowed again.

### **Q: Is this check fast?**
A: Yes! It's instant - no database queries. Uses already-loaded data.

### **Q: What if a student is overdue?**
A: The book is still blocked from being borrowed by others until the current borrower returns it.

### **Q: Can I override this?**
A: Not through the UI. This is by design to prevent data errors.

## 🎊 Summary

Your Book Borrowing System now has:

✅ **Smart Validation** - Prevents double borrowing
✅ **User Feedback** - Shows who has the book and when
✅ **Data Integrity** - Only one active borrowing per book
✅ **Professional UX** - Catches errors before they happen
✅ **Zero Errors** - Clean, production-ready code

---

## 📊 Before & After

### **BEFORE** ❌
```
Problem: Could accidentally create duplicate borrowings
Result: Two students could show as having the same book
```

### **AFTER** ✅
```
Solution: System checks if book is already borrowed
Result: Only one student can have a book at a time
```

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**The system now prevents the same book from being borrowed by multiple students at the same time.**

When someone tries to borrow an already-borrowed book, they see:
- ❌ Clear error message
- 👤 Who currently has the book
- 📅 When it's due to be returned
